Here is the code

```Javascript
const compose = (...fns) => (...args) => fns.reduceRight((res, fn) => [fn.call(null, ...res)], args)[0];
```

we gonna use this to combine function together. Dont get scared this shit. I gonna explain you guys now.

Here is simpe version of above function:

```Javascript
const compose2 = (f, g) => x => f(g(x));
```

f and g are functions and x is the value being "piped" through them.

```Javascript
const toUpperCase = x => x.toUpperCase();
const exclaim = x => `${x}!`;
const shout = compose(exclaim, toUpperCase);

shout('send in the clowns'); // "SEND IN THE CLOWNS!"
```

In our definition of compose, the g will run before the f (since we use `reduceRight`), creating a right to left flow of data. This is much more readable than nesting a bunch of function calls. Without compose, the above would read:

```Javascript
const shout = x => exclaim(toUpperCase(x));
```
